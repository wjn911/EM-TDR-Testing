# Numerical Scheme: 2.5-D approach

In most of the case, the pipeline has relative thin pipe wall but very long length, making it is very expensive to simulate in full 3-D scenario. To compensate such dilema, we addopt the 2.5-D approach: First, we simulate the cross-section of every possiable pipe condition. As result, we can calculate the characteristic impednace per unit length of these conditions. The cross-section simulation is shown in the following figure as an example:

Secondly, we assemble these sections in the longitudinal into a 1-D model and simulate the EM-TDR response.

# Numerical simulation test
## Numerical simulation Scenario 1: Dis-bond coating, intact coating, no corrosion
In this case, the intruding fluid is mostly air. A little air-packet is form between coating layer and metalic pipe. We also demonstrate varies thickness of the intruding air layer.
The result is shown below:

## Numerical simulation Scenario 1: Dis-bond coating, broken coating, no corrosion

Here we demonstrate a example of 2-D cross-section simulation of water intrusion scenario with both intact coating as well as broken coating:

# Numerical sensitivity test

In this numerical test, we add the metalic loss to the model. 
The water intrusion is under the coating, 30&deg; wide. The water layer is 10% casing thickness. 
Casing corrosion: 10&deg; wide, filled with water.
Casing corrosion lost: 10% of the casing thickness per step. In the following figure, we only show every 20% casing thichness due to the limited space.

| *Numerical simulation results* |

For EM-TDR be able to detect the reflected signal, we are more interested in the characteristic impedance changes when corrosion happens. Here we plot the characteristic impedance changes via different corrosion size as well coating damage size: 
- Intrusion angle: 10&deg; â€“ 30&deg;, step: 10&deg;
- Intrusion thickness: 50% -- 200% of casing thickness, step: 50%
- Coating broken angle: 10&deg; -- 30&deg;, step: 10&deg;
- Casing corrosion angle : 10&deg; -- 30&deg;, step: 10&deg;
- Casing corrosion thickness: 20% -- 80% of the casing thickness, step: 20%

Here are the results plotted in figures:
